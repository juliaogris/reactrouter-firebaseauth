This bare bones ReactJS sampe shows Router 4.0.0-beta.6 interacting with Firebase authentication. It's been created with `generate-react-app`. 

Check out the

Shamelessly stolen from:

* Tyler McGinnis [Auth with React Router V4 and Firebase V3](https://github.com/tylermcginnis/react-router-firebase-auth)
* React Router docs on [auth workflow](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/examples/auth-workflow)
